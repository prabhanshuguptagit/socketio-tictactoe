app.js 
==============

publicDir = require('path').join(__dirname, '/public');

app.use('/static', express.static(__dirname + '/public')); 

Make folder called public in root dir. Add this to serve static files such as css, js, img etc.

I faced the same problem, but did not want to use any external modules or frameworks before I understand what's going on under the hood. So, this is how I've solved the issue for CSS file for myself. Hopefully it will be useful for someone.
Whenever I have a request for /style.css I call this simple function:

function style(response) {

  console.log("Request handler 'style' was called.");

  fs.readFile("style.css", function(error, file) {

    if(error) {

        response.writeHead(500, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});

        response.write(error + "\n");

        response.end();

    } else {
        response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/css"});
        response.write(file);
        response.end();
    }
  });
}
Basically, we read our static files and send them back upon request. Note that you have to take care about routing your requests.
